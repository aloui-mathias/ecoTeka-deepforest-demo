# Demo for ecoTeka DeepForest

This project is a deminstration of DeepForest (https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest) capabilities with IGN Orthoimagery. The goal is to show the potential of DeepForest for tree detection in urban area with aerial images from the open and free IGN data.

## Linked projects

This project use a custom script access the IGN data base :

https://github.com/aloui-mathias/pyqgis_IGN_WMTS

An API is developped to use DeepForest inside larger project :

https://gitlab.com/natural-solutions/ecoteka-deepforest

The goal of this project is to be a demonstration for the tree detection part of the ecoTeka project :

https://gitlab.com/natural-solutions/ecoteka

## Installation

To use this script, you need the python version of QGIS available with anaconda.

```
# Creation of the conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

You can print the script usage with the command :

```
python script/main.py --help
```

## Geojson Input

The script use a geojson input from overpass-turbo.eu with a request like :

```
/*
This has been generated by the overpass-turbo wizard.
The original search was:
“park”
*/
[out:json][timeout:25];
// gather results
(
  // query part for: “park”
  node["leisure"="park"]({{bbox}});
  way["leisure"="park"]({{bbox}});
  relation["leisure"="park"]({{bbox}});
);
// print results
out body;
>;
out skel qt;
```

If you multiple features (with the above request multiple parks), the script will run on each feature with two .tiff (image and image-prediction) per feature.

## Example

You can run the example in docs :

```
# Command to run the script
python script/main.py --geojson docs/export.geojson

# High resolution is vailable for the example
python script/main.py --geojson docs/export.geojson --high-resolution
```

The file image-prediction.tiff in docs is the result of the second command (here the png version) :

## Development known issues

- The Qt application in QGIS can have troubles depending on your display settings. If you have an error with :
  ```
  qt.qpa.plugin: could not load the qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
  ```
  You need to set your environment variable QT_QPA_PLATFORM to an available plugin for your setup. The plugin "offscreen" is available for all os :
  ```
  conda env config vars set QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
  ```

- If you ave an error file not found for the default geojson file, check :
  - That you are inside "ecoteka-deepforest-demo/" folder
  - That you have placed an "export.geojson" from overpass-turbo.eu (like the one in docs) inside "ecoteka-deepforest-demo/data/" folder
